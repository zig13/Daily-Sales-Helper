This Windows Execeutable is a package combining my Python (2.72) scripts with the bare-bones of Python needed to run them on Windows.
I made it partially as a way to speed-up the task of calculating 'Daily Sales' (i.e. taking the sales from the day before, adding them to the weekly running total and comparing them to targets and last year values) but mostly just as a fun project througth which I could advance my knowlege in Python. Of course at the back of my mind I knew that I would never be able to actually use it at work as that would require bringng it in on a memory stick which I almost certainly not allowed to do. In addition my manager is mildly technophobic and would not approve of the 'complication' of something which is, to be fair, pretty simple.

I release it in the hope that:
1)Someone in a similar role might find use of it
2)Someone trying to get their head round Python can make use of it to improve thier understanding

Neither script makes use of classes as they are something I am yet to understand/see the point in, but they do make use of the ConfigParser, OS, Decimal and DateTime importable modules - all of which I would recommend having a mess around with. In fact my use of the ConfigParser in these scripts has inspired me to build an Adventure Game Engine (Adenzig) that imports all of it's fluff and varibles from files read by the ConfigParser

Seeing as you have chosen to download the windows execeutable, modification is not possible but you do not need Python installed to run and use it. In the very least, it will show you what is possible with Python and may spark an interest in learning it. Feel free to download the scripts as well if you want to see how it works (it's quite human-readable and you can always whack anything you don't understand into Google)
