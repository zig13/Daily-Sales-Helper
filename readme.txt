These two Python (2.72) scripts consitute my Daily Sales Helper
I made it partially as a way to speed-up the task of calculating 'Daily Sales' (i.e. taking the sales from the day before, adding them to the weekly running total and comparing them to targets and last year values) but mostly just as a fun project througth which I could advance my knowlege in Python. Of course at the back of my mind I knew that I would never be able to actually use it at work as that would require bringng it in on a memory stick which I almost certainly not allowed to do. In addition my manager is mildly technophobic and would not approve of the 'complication' of something which is, to be fair, pretty simple.

I release it in the hope that:
1)Someone in a similar role might find use of it
2)Someone trying to get their head round Python can make use of it to improve thier understanding

Neither script makes use of classes as they are something I am yet to understand/see the point in, but they do make use of the ConfigParser, OS, Decimal and DateTime importable modules - all of which I would recommend having a mess around with. In fact my use of the ConfigParser in these scripts has inspired me to build an Adventure Game Engine (Adenzig) that imports all of it's fluff and varibles from files read by the ConfigParser

Naturally if you use them in a unmodified/barely-modified form, I would apreciate some recognition/credit but otherwise do-what-you-will. I created them for fun so I do not expect or require any other gain.
